## 💡 Key Learnings

1. **Gradient Contrast**: Darker gradients (`purple-600/pink-600`) provide better text readability than lighter ones
2. **Tooltip Positioning**: Fixed positioning (`-top-14`) works better than relative (`bottom-full`)
3. **Color Display**: Small circles (`w-12 h-12`) are more efficient than large squares for color swatches
4. **User Feedback**: Immediate visual changes based on screenshots accelerate development
